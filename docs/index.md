What git documentation says about rebase:

???+ "quote from _<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing>_"

    One point of view on this is that your repository’s commit history is a **record of what actually happened**.

???+ "quote from _<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing>_"

    The opposing point of view is that the commit history is the **story of how your project was made**. 
    You wouldn’t publish the first draft of a book, so why show your messy work?
    When you’re working on a project, you may need a record of all your missteps and dead-end paths, but when it’s time to show your work to the world, you may want to tell a more coherent story of how to get from A to B.
